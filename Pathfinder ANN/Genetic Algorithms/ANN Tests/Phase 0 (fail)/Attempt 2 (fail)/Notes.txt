Player B starts off correctly, the AI has learned that this is the best starting move.
Its first turn is flawless.

Player A keeps trying to make a melee attack, but it is not in melee range, so it defaults to "End Turn".

Player B then keeps taking the same "Move for ranged" action (which is not necessary because it is already in
line of sight) and taking a single attack (should be a full attack).

They then repeat this cycle forever.

Noteably, Player B will also try to take this action even when holding a melee weapon, causing the game to stall.
